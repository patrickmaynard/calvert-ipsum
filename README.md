#To install dependencies: 

```
npm install -g grunt-cli

bower install bootstrap

cd bower_components/bootstrap

npm install
```

(Note: I think I checked all the installed js dependencies into version control. I wouldn't necessarily do that these days, but when I built this, I didn't yet know what a .gitignore file was for. Maybe I'll go back through and clean up someday.)
